      <hr>The <big><strong>HyperText</strong></big> Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
